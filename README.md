# N++ Palette Creator - Eddy 2019

### How to use:
* Load a palette by clicking the **Load Palette** button, a folder selection dialog will open.
* The colors are classified in tabs, and each tab has a list. **Double-click** on the list elements to view the colors for that element (e.g. *Objects* -> *Exit door*).
* Write a name and click the **Create palette** to generate the palette folder with all the files inside. The folder will be created in the program's folder, without dialog.

### More info:
You will have to put the palette folder into the *Palettes* folder of your N++ installation directory, inside your Steam folder. It should be something like this:
  * **Linux**: `home/<user>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`
  * **Windows**: `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`
  * **mac**: `home/<user>/Library/ ... /steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`

Important note: It's likely you won't have a folder named *Palettes*, in which case you will have to **create it**.
